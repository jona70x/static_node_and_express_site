        .about-bio

          p Greetings. My name is Jonathan Carpio, I am originally from Venezuela, but I have been living in the Bay Area, CA, since 2019. I obtained an Associate's degree in Foreign Trade, but in February of 2022, I started a new journey to become a Software Engineer, specifically a Full Stack JavaScript developer. 
          p I am a long-life learner who loves learning new technologies and enjoys playing video games (Lots of them).
          p Although I haven't been able to work professionally in the tech industry, I have a broad work experience in multiple industries. I excel in customer relationships and enjoy working as a part of a team.
          p Thank you!
