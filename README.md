# static_node_and_express_site
Welcome to my sixth tech degree project, a project portfolio where you can find a variety of projects I have been able to accomplish.
I have used Express, Node.js, and Pug in this project. 

From the original desing, I have modified font color, family, background color and added styles to buttons.
